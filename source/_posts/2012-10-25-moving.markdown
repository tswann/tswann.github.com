Just Keep Moving
----------------

I've finally got round to re-locating my blog from posterous to it's shiny new home on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com).

It was a while coming really. I've been a bit desirous of [Jame's](http://yobriefca.se/) setup using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) for some while now and {"just needed to give myself the requisite shove"} to sort it out.

Now all it needs is some shiny content! I'll spend some time migrating the old stuff over, then it'll be time to plough ahead with some exciting new ramblings!

I might have something to say on the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) shortly as my order _finally_ shipped after 3 months of tortured waiting.

The [Lego case](http://www.thedailybrick.co.uk/lego-sets/custom/lego-custom-raspberry-pi-case.html) is obviously being assembled as we speak...

__*EDIT*__ Hmm. On second thoughts - lifes too short by far. You can find the old stuff at [tswann.posterous.com](http://tswann.posterous.com). Enjoy!
